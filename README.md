EOP-1.1.3
=========

Excitement Open Platform (EOP) is an open source software platform containing state-of-the-art algorithms for recognizing texual entailment relations: given two text fragments, one named text and the other named hypothesis, the task consists in recognizing whether the hypothesis can be inferred from the text.


Major changes from EOP-1.1.2 to EOP-1.1.3:
 
###### BIUTEE
* tracer: support for researchers is provided by a visual tracing tool which visualizes every step of the inference.
* pre-trained models

###### EDIT DISTANCE EDA
* different possibilities for stop word removal.
* different algorithms for normalized edit distance computation.
