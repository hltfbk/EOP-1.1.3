EOP-1.1.3
=========

Excitement Open Platform (EOP) is an open source software platform containing state-of-the-art algorithms for recognizing texual entailment relations: given two text fragments, one named text and the other named hypothesis, the task consists in recognizing whether the hypothesis can be inferred from the text.


Major changes from EOP-1.1.2 to EOP-1.1.3:
 
###### BIUTEE
* tracer: support for researchers is provided by a visual tracing tool which visualizes every step of the inference
* pre-trained models

###### EDIT DISTANCE EDA
* different strategies for stop word removal

##### EOPRunner(i.e. EOP via command line interface)
* better separation between processing steps: preprocessing, training, testing and scoring can each be done separately

##### EOP wiki documentation:
* Quick Start and Step by Step tutorial revised
*
